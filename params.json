It uses python and postgres SQL to process the data and perform feature engineering, transforms the text with TF-IDF, models the data with a weighted random forest, and plots the results with matplotlib and seaborn.\r\n\r\n###[Housing market model](https://github.com/mattlichti/housing_model)\r\n\r\nI was part of the second place team at the [2015 San Francisco Hack for Change hackathon](http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/hackforchange/). We built an agent based model to demonstrate the effects of adding housing supply on housing prices and displacement of renters.\r\n\r\n![photo](https://github.com/mattlichti/mattlichti.github.io/blob/master/images/_DSC0596-001.JPG?raw=true)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
