{"name":"Matt Lichti","tagline":"Data Scientist Seeking New Opportunities","body":"## About Me\r\n\r\nMy background is in electrical engineering, and I have experience as a patent examiner in the vehicle and navigation data processing field. I left the patent office to spend the next couple years traveling and volunteering in Asia and Latin America. After taking [a machine learning class on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info), I became fascinated with big data and the wide range of applications of data science tools. I moved to San Francisco and enrolled at [Zipfian Academy](http://www.zipfianacademy.com/), where I expanded my data science skills by working with data to solve a variety of real world problems.\r\n\r\n## Projects I'm working on\r\n\r\n###[How to get loans funded on kiva.org](http://mattlichti.github.io/kiva-fundraising-success/)\r\n[This project](http://mattlichti.github.io/kiva-fundraising-success/) analyzes microfinance loans on [kiva.org](http://www.kiva.org) to predict which loans will get funded and identify the key features of successful loans. It uses python and postgres SQL to process the data and perform feature engineering, transforms the text with TF-IDF, models the data with a weighted random forest, and plots the results with matplotlib and seaborn.\r\n\r\n###[Housing market model](https://github.com/mattlichti/housing_model)\r\n\r\nI was part of the second place team at the [2015 San Francisco Hack for Change hackathon](http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/hackforchange/). We built an agent based model to demonstrate the effects of adding housing supply on housing prices and displacement of renters. \r\n\r\n## Data Science Skills\r\n\r\n* **Machine Learning**: Linear and Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Boosting, SVM, Naive Bayes, K-means, Clustering, PCA, NLP, Recommenders\r\n* **Python**: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, StatsModels, NLTK, Flask, Matplotlib\r\n* **Databases**: Postgres SQL, MongoDB\r\n* **Distributed Computing**: Map Reduce, GraphLab, Spark (beginner)\r\n* **Statistics**: A/B testing, Multi-Armed Bandit, Bayesian Inference, Hypothesis testing\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n[My Github Profile](https://github.com/mattlichti)\r\n\r\n[My Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattlichti)\r\n\r\n[My Resume](http://bit.ly/1K5UCTs)\r\n\r\n![photo](https://github.com/mattlichti/mattlichti.github.io/blob/master/images/_DSC0596-001.JPG?raw=true)\r\n\r\nI love traveling!
